title: Note Hack
---
##### *A super-l33t music notation game for kids. At this time, Note Hack exists in an early planning stage (addressing only rhythm, played on a dry-erase board). These are my notes regarding future changes.*

## Commands
*These commands do not change the values of notes.*

* **split** - replace a note with two notes

* **trash** - replace a note with a rest

* **untrash** - replace a rest with a note

## Goals
*(in consideration)*

* match a rhythm
* create a rhythm
* compete
	* boys versus girls
	* teacher versus class
		* escalating point system
			* number of commands determines point value
	* random student selection

## Flavor
* hacker stories

## Music Education Extensions
* perform
* interpret

## Implementation
* dry-erase board
* digital media
* actual application
	* bash commands
	* graphical output
